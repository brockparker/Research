	VOTING!!!
	Updating Sophia plots
		Water damage
			Blurring sort of recreates the pre-damage images, although edge effects make it hard to compare
		Wavelength montage
			Creating movie of wavelengths to see how signal changes
			Signal changes likely due to both monochromator changes and fringing due to detector size
			Some data corrupted - seems to only be a side effect of downloading the data
			
Wednesday - 2024/11/06
	Sophia wavelength montage
		Very overexposed at short wavelengths - monochromator seems much less even at short wavelengths, diffuser would likely not be enough
		Also uneven and overexposed around 385 nm
		Final movie all have same limits, may want to recreate with limits based on the region of interest we optimized the exposure time for
	Sophia QE
		Finishing compiling all photodiode data into one dataframe/csv
		Need to add the photodiode error into dataframe
		Of note - photodiode response is not true, but rather a sample response curve from manufacturer, NOT NIST
	Compiling Caltech Optical Observatories software for Steve
		Apparently can't get it to work on Centos7
		Need cmake - Run sudo apt-get install cmake (already have)
		Need gcc - Run sudo apt-get install gcc (already have)
		Need cfitsio - Download the latest version https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/software/fitsio/c/cfitsio_latest.tar.gz

Thursday - 2024/11/07
	Alex and Co. Visit
		Lab tour - very interested in using our setup to characterize a few different CCD QEs in as far UV as we can go (down to 100nm according to Affy)
		They are currently debating two electron production at high photon energies, beginning to see a bump ~300nm from two electron production
			Want us to see if we see the same for any of our detectors, and maybe characterize some of theirs once they get them UV optimized at JPL
		Why don't we just use the integrating sphere, apparently it is broken but I am sure we can buy a new one
		Their QE currently does not include any inherent errors in the photodiode calibration
		Discussed how we plan to mount the Skipper to the cold finger
			They have had minor issues with their direct contact, but it may be easier to just clamp it on from the back without any springs or washers and use indium to create the thermal connection - could also copy aafaque and have pressure put on by opposite thermal expansions
		Very interested in mounting onto monochromator and the `plug and play' ability 
			Commercial monochromator from McPherson
			What do we do about stray light? - The slits and collimator help, but we need to add baffles before the slits and before the detector near the diffuser to help reduce stray light, Affy did stray light analysis and it shouldn't be too big of a deal
		May have some concern about dark current
			Bulk dark current shouldn't have much of an effect, surface will be a bigger deal
			Even bigger issue will probably be thermal dark from any IR sources - skippers are much much (>10x ~600 microns) thicker than EMCCDs
	Need to confirm with Affy how the light actually reaches the detector, is it not covered by the cold shroud, or does this help to properly disperse the light
	Finishing setting up COO Camera interface
		- Download latest version https://github.com/CaltechOpticalObservatories/camera-interface.git
		- Unzip
		- Inside the camera-interface-main/build folder, remove all files, rm -rf * (don't remove the .gitignore file)	
		- Run cmake .. (has to be cmake, not make)
		- Run make
	To test the Camera interface, inside of the camera-interface-main/build folder,
		- Run the camera server, ../bin/camerad ../Config/demo/demo.cfg --foreground OR ../bin/camerad -d ../Config/demo/demo.cfg
		- Run the archon emulator, ../bin/emulator ../Config/demo/demo.cfg
			Getting error "no instrument specified with -i <instrument>"
			Can specify -i generic, seems to make it work
		- Run the unit tests, ../bin/run_unit_tests
			This file just doesn't exist??
		- To connect to the running camera interface, inside of camera-interface-main/bin run telnet localhost 3031
			From here, can run load, expose, open, etc.
			Everything seems to work, difficult to test without Archon connected, will revisit next week with Steve
	TODO - Install Ubuntu and COO Camera-interface on my laptop to test with Archon
	Sophia Data Reduction Anshul
		Making a few example plots to compare with Anshul's data reduction script
		Comparing master bias and darks vs individual, plotting each reduced image, etc.
		Have to be careful when saving and opening data - data from sophia is in (1, 2048, 2048) array for some reason, but we save it as (2048, 2048), make sure data[0] is appropriate
		
Friday - 11/08/2024
	Steward Internal Symposium!
	Having lots of issues transferring data from steward desktop onto GitHub/my laptop
		Maximum push size is ~500MB, will have to do only 1 day of data at a time moving forward
		Other notes, pushing and committing from the CLI requires a personal access token
			I generated a fine grained token that never expires with full access to all repos
			Will need a different PAT in order to access the Hamden Lab (group) repos
	Back to working on Sophia QE
		WTF was I doing with the photodiode dataframe
		Adding function to correct the photodiode counts at the side port to counts at the main port - Don't have this file, just assuming its unit for now to retain functional form
		TODO - Is the error on the photodiode current just the std of the total counts minus the std of the dark, or is it just the std of the total current?
		Verified photon flux error using the std of the current is the same as the error adding or subtracting the upper or lower photon rate (from the standard deviation) from the average - as expected, just wanted a sanity check
		Adding documentation to all photodiode reduction parts
	Meeting with Anshul
		Going through some of the basics of image reduction - bias, darks, flats, etc.
		Quick conversation with Jacob about how the QE will not be exact - only manufacturer calibration, different distances, poor illumination
		Made up an example PTC for Sophia
			Very weird, instead of levelling off at low signals it plummets
			TODO - Perhaps it needs to be reduced data
			
Tuesday - 11/12/2024
	Reading Janesick PTC Section
		Sounds like we may need to plot differenced images
		Also should be using one fixed region across all frames
		May need to include some dark frames for the smallest signals, seems we didnt go low enough with out exposure times
	Sophia PTC
		Going to retry with the reduced PTC data
		Running into issues again with buffer size - redownloading data seems to have fixed the issue
		Apparently broke my reduction script in the process :(
	EMCCD Darks
		Starting new set of darks for Affy
			-115 C, VSS 1, taped up a couple more light leaks
		LIGHT IS FINALLY OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
		Next set in the morning
			-100 C, VSS 1
		Everything seemed to go smoothly
			Temperature control laptop had a forced windows update, but the cryocooler is still at the same temperature
		TODO - Run warm up darks tomorrow, base them off of file "run regular darks"
		
Wednesday - 11/13/2024
	Sophia PTC
		Found issue with image reduction for 20240607 - all darks are bad, they are all just biases
			Adding additional case to catch divide by zero in the dark exposure time when averaging darks - shouldn't be an issue for individual file reduction
		Adding in the darks (that are actual darks) gives the low signal needed to see the read noise floor
			I'm not sure if we can go shorter in exposure time - need to ask if Affy uses darks or if the EMCCD just has lower counts
			Will have Anshul fit actual data once Affy confirms
			By eye, looks like a RN of ~5.5 e-, gain is close to 1 - consistent with ~100kHz-1MHz speed and 1 gain mode
	Running warm up darks
		Simply shutting off cryocooler - Final cooling time was around 2 hours
		Take darks and biases as it warms up
			Chose 20, 60, 120s - should only warm up ~2K during one cycle
		Have to get temperatures from temperature recording script via image save time
			Changed from 120s to 10s fidelity, should be able to pinpoint closely - TODO - check how much the temp changes across 2 minute exposure

Thursday - 11/14/2024
	Meeting with Steve
		Testing COO camerad on Ubuntu
		All seems to work, need to have both serve and emulator open at same time
			The emulator is the Archon, server controls it, connect to the Archon with telnet (or others)
			Have to edit demo.cfg and demo.acf to include absolute file paths, fixes error opening file
			Once connected, run open then load to connect to Archon and load config file
		Some commands unavailable (all of the commands listed in the emulator section of the documentation
			Still have to run as generic instrument - possibly why Archon commands are unavailable
			Can run basic commands - open, load, expose, exptime, etc.
	Installing COO on laptop
		Make sure Ubuntu is fully updated!
		Issues installing cfitsio
			Need zlib - sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
			Need g++ - sudo apt-get install g++ (not installed by default?)
		Had to updates some filepaths - everything should be installed to /usr/local, NOT /usr/local/cfitsio or /usr/local/CCfits
		Make sure to update absolute paths in demo config files
		All working just like on Desktop - some issues with timeouts, maybe just be laptop artifacts

Friday - 11/15/2024
	Testing Archon with Steve
		Putting all files (waveforms, config files, acf files, python files, etc) onto skipper github repo in Hamden-Lab organization
		TODO - Need to get WDL installed and working on laptop
			Need for .acf file to control the Archon
			Steve changed clock names in skipper.signals
				Haven't been changed in skipper.waveform, commented out
			Some functions changed in skipper.seq
			Have to verify
			Need to grab ReadPixel.h from wdlfiles-master
			Have to add / to beginning of skipper.waveform
			Verify all paths in Makefile are correct
				GPP = /usr/bin/gpp
				GFLAGS = +c "/*" "*/" +c "//" "\n" +c "\\\n" ""
				WDLPATH = /home/baparker/code/wdl
				ACFPATH = /home/baparker/code/skipperfiles
		Couldn't get WDL to run, using dave.acf (renamed to skipper.acf) for testing
		To run the Archon, need to download all python files and specify proper IP (10.0.0.2) and port (4242)
			camera_info.py, qccd.py, qccd_hosts.py
			Aslo need qccd.cfg and skipper.acf - all in /camera-interface-main/Config/skipper
		Steve is able to connect to the Archon using direct ethernet and the GUI
		Both of us are unable to connect using the adapter - is it just this adapter or any adapter?
	Meeting with Anshul
		Interrupted by Aafaque, discussing Skipper specifics
		Working on PTC
		PTC seems to be okay using reduced data, although this is incorrect
		Need to use differenced images
			Is this difference between sequential images or all images?
		
Monday - 11/18/2024
	Sophia QE
		Finishing QE analysis
		Data from June looks okay - relatively smooth with a few decreases, although it doesn't really seem to match the curves from the Sophia data sheet
		Data from October is even worse - significantly more variations and practically flat at longer wavelengths, doesn't match data sheet curve at all

	Working on HW
	Archon connection
		Borrowed different ethernet adapter from Noah - still having the same issues
		When connected to telnet, use Ctrl+5 then type close to close connection to Archon
		Both adapters let me change the manual IPV4 address - have to use 10.0.0.2:4242 to connect
		No commands are ever received by the server - still works when connected to the emulator
	Meeting with Steve
		As long as we set the IP address we are able to connect to the Archon
		Turns out everything was working, we just need to connect to the server, NOT to the Archon
			telnet localhost 3031
		The server handles the connection to the Archon using open
		Most commands still have errors, but those are expected and we can fix them (missing/renamed commands)
		Having issues using the Python interface
			Need to enable verbose modes, seems like the code never makes it to __send_threaded_command()
			Perhaps this is a python version issues, although not likely
			Code never seems to actually send the open command, although the server recognizes and accepts the connection, just never sees the command
			
Friday - 11/22/2024
	Meeting with Erika
		Sophia QE analysis
			Verify all steps of the process are correct
			Plot photodiode current versus wavelength, photons versus wavelength, sophia region counts versus wavelength
			Figure out which step is causing all the variation and large jumps - these should not be there, it should be relatively smooth
		Mentoring Committee
			Carlos, Erika, Eiichi, Jared
		Focus on QE analysis over PTC, keep having Anshul work on PTC
	Meeting with Anshul
		Finishing up PTC analysis
			Using the difference images seem to give us approximately the correct solution
				Following https://www.msss.com/http/near_cal/robinson_stuff/ltc.html
					Generate average dark frame at each exposure time
					Generate average science frame at each exposure time
					Subtract two above averaged images to get signal frame
						Calculate mean of nxn region
					Subtract each of two science images from signal image and take STD of same nxn region
						Calculate mean STD of the two
						Need some noise correction for the number of average frames (divide by sqrt(1.25) for 4)
						TODO: Find where this value comes from
					Plot these values
				The shape is still a little funky at high and low values
				Using small regions on detector to weed out any variations from non-uniform light
			Fitting a line to the traditional PTC seems be a slope about 0.5 ADU/e- (2 e-/ADU) in log space as expected, with read noise of a few electrons
				Fit also gives a gain around 0.5 (2)
			Trying variance method instead
				Using variance instead of std, fitting the slope in linear space gives a very similar gain of about 0.5 ADU/e- (2 e-/ADU)
			Both seem to be in agreement with Sophia data sheet mid-gain
				Default on the software is high gain (4 e-/ADU)
	Meeting with Shashank
		Quick discussion about processing the warm-up dark data
		Had to find the temperature data
			Doesn't exist for the detector?
			Extracting from the HTML file - Shashank knows how
		First calculating raw dark rates from each exposure
			Should also try calculating dark rates by fitting the three points we have at each temperature
				How much does the temperature vary across one set of exposures, can we do this?

	Meeting with Steve cancelled
		TODO: Run py archon controller with verbose mode
	Studying for ISM Review
	Found a very neat CCD simulation paper
		https://github.com/craiglagegit/Poisson_CCD
		Numerically solves Poisson's equations inside of the CCD to model numerous effects: blooming, brighter-fatter, charge diffusion
		May be neat to plug in hypothetical skipper values to see what it predicts
		Not sure if it simulates theoretical images - probably, but the focus seems to be on pixel distortion effects
		Currently designed to simulate LSST CCDs - ITL STA3800C CCD and the E2V CCD250
	Still want to try to get pyxel to run to verify my Skipper simulator (that has not been started)

	Meeting with Anshul
		Still working on PTC analysis
		Gain values from Anshul's analysis following the above links with the std 0.5 slope line fit agrees within error (~4.5 e/ADU) with values published in Sophia datasheet
		Attempting to follow methodology from Aafaque's code
			Follows Janesick exactly
			First bias subtract (offset subtract) each of the two same-exposure-time flat/science images
			The signal is calculated as the mean of these two images
				Then calculate the mean of regions inside of these images
			The error is calculated as the variance of the difference image
				Subtract one bias corrected image from the other (at the same exposure time)
				Calculate the std of a region
				Divide the calculated error by sqrt(2) as the error is reduced by the square root of the number of exposures
			Get read noise as the standard deviation of the bias frame
				Seems to be slightly too high (?), around 5.6 ADU
				Intersects PTC at non zero signal (~10 ADU)
			Fit line to the bias subtracted data
				Only selecting points between 2e3 and 1e4, as per Aafaque
				Gain should be relatively insensitive to read noise calculation
				In reality varies greatly with different read noises, including 0 - fitting the raw data
					Sometimes get negative gains???
				Using the above read noise, get ~0.4 e/DN, far off of predicted 4 e/DN
			PTC appears to be correct shape, can even see full well ~65k

	Meeting with Erika
		FINESST - will go over outline next meeting
		TODO: Write outline (lol)
		PTC
			Need to fix the slope to 0.5 - will have huge effect on calculated gain
			The intercept should be converted back into linear space, currently in log space
				Doing so gives gain ~2.54 e/ADU - closer to expected 4
			Instead of using intercept, draw line at y=1 and use intercept of that with line, doesn't need to be converted back to log space?
			Should really be calculating the gain from the variance method instead
		Once done with this gain PTC, take data for the other gain values and see if it actually changes as we expect it to

Friday - 12/20/2024
	Meeting with Erika
		Cancelled!
	PTC with Anshul
		Are the equations we using even correct?
			I am currently taking the standard deviation of the difference image, which is formed by first bias subtracting the average of the bias from each flat image, divided by the square root of two to correct for averaging the images. I then calculate the average signal from the average of the two flat images, after bias subtracting
			Affy gets the signal the same way - although it doesn't agree???? He gets the variance following the equation in Janseick, however he does not subtract the average difference image signal from the difference image before calculating the standard deviation
			Anshul calculates the difference image average by just taking the average of the region of the average of the two flat images, not bias subtracted and not difference
		Need to verify if Affy's equations give the same as mine
			Signal sort of agrees, but not quite?
			Variance way off
		Turns out I was subtracting the mean of the full bias image, not the region
			This brings my and Affy's signals into agreement, noise is still off
			His noise agrees if I change his to subtract the mean of the difference image when calculating the variance

Saturday - 12/28/2024
	Putting together orders
		Desiccant
			Looks like bags will be best
			Can we bulk order these or will they go bad left out
			Low humidity bags? We want humidity as low as possible inside of the dry box
			https://www.mcmaster.com/1523T63/   - probably 2 packs of 5 to start, I imagine that will last
		Double check account these are all going on

Wednesday - 1/1/2025
	Working on PTC reduction
		Intercept converted from log space to linear space (i.e. data space)
		Left column is where the read noise is calculated from

				Intercept (DN)	Gain (e/DN)	Read Noise (DN)
		Raw Bias STD	0.90960		1.20864		5.60276
		Red. Bias STD	0.91048		1.20630		5.60276				Random region selection gives slightly different intercept/gain	
		Error Minimum	0.91757		1.18772		4.91075
		None		0.97381		1.05449		0
		Eyeball		0.91689		1.18949		4.97				Getting as close to straight line as possible

		Gain seems fairly insensitive to read noise, at least within a reasonable value for the read noise around ~5 DN
		Fairly strong correlation between read noise and gain, higher RN gives higher gain, between ~1.05 and ~1.21 - gain should be within there		

		Need to fit for the read noise instead, will fit the full data to a straight line

Thursday - 1/2/2025
	Back to PTC
		Trying to fit the read noise as well as the line
		Derived equation to fit to, seems to match if I type in values manually
		Fit gives similar gain ~1.1, but nonsensical read noise ~1.93

		Cannot seem to possibly get the fit to line up with the data
			Read noise subtracted data curves around a straight line
			Read noise added straight line does not have a sharp enough knee/corner
			Could be some characteristic of the detector, does not seem to affect calculation of read noise and gain

		Still should have gain ~4 e/ADU (or 1 or 2) and read noise ~7.0 e
			header says high gain, low noise, speed 1 MHz x 2 ports = 2 MHz

Friday - 1/3/2025
	Final attempt to find read noise from fitting the flat part of the PTC (below 1)
		Gives varying results from 5.5-5.55, in agreement with the read noise from the bias
				Intercept (DN)	Gain (e/DN)	Read Noise (DN)
		Flat Fit 1	0.90866		1.21112		5.51701
		Flat Fit 2	0.91029		1.20680		5.51098
		Flat Fit 3	0.91057		1.20604		5.54748
		Flat Fit 4	0.90976		1.20819		5.54659			
			Using same 2e3 to 4e4 fit limits

	Overall most methods agree with a gain a little over 1, and a read noise around 6e, or ~5 ADU, which would seem to agree with the high noise (fast speed) 7e and the low gain 1e/ADU
		This does not agree with the settings in the header...			

Saturday - 1/4/2025

			12V, is 1.5A enough?
		Looks like all the needed voltages and sequences are on the github now, all labeled _microchip
		
	Trying to compile LTADaemon
		ROOT disappeared? where
		Reinstalling following directions above
		Looks like needed package (libtbb2) was depricated
			- Run, sudo apt-get install libtbb-dev
			Seems to have fixed the issue, compiled properly
		All tests in test.sh and testsseq.sh passed
		
	Installing slack
		Sudo snap install slack
		
	Another meeting with Steve
		Testing LTA
		NOTE - Because we are using the USB to Ethernet adapter, have to change the manual IPV4/6 address
			For LTA:
				Address - 192.168.133.0
				Netmask - 255.255.255.0
				DNS - 128.192.11.234
			For Archon:
				Address - 10.0.0.100
				Netmask - 255.255.255.0
				DNS - 128.192.11.234
				
		Connection successful - Used default IP 192.168.133.7
		Readout successful - lta read
		  	Loads the queued readout sequence, set by source /init/init_skp_lta_v2_smart.sh
		  	Make sure to change the above file to the sequence and voltage file in use
		  		sequencers/sequencer_microchip.xml
				voltage_skp_lta_v2_microchip.sh
		Properly calculates readout time ~600 ms
		
		Seems to have some kind of built in method to tell if a CCD is plugged in
			Error no data received from LTA
			Perhaps it measures the video signals?
			
		Connecting to Oscope
			Almost all ungrounded connections give wild signals >70 V
			Need to ground to tiny ground hole on the left (looking from 50-pin connector)
			Testing the pinout to the detector, some clock signals can be seen briefly
				There are various biases that can be seen as well, and they change between the regular readout and the epurge, which should have higher voltages
			
		
Thursday - 1/17/2025
	Meeting with Aafaque
		Quick discussion about PTC
			Need to use smaller range for fitting the linear regime - current reigon goes too high
			May have to add a 'fudge' factor for the read noise
				The values from the fit/bias may not give the best read noise to give a perfectly linear read noise subtracted PTC
			Should try to optimize the read noise to give the most linear read noise subtracted PTC
	Designing LTA Case
		Basing it around an arduino case
		First had to model the LTA - all values in inches
		Bottom shell that pops into the LTA, top shell will attach to the bottom with screws
		Need to make sure to include all of the proper connectors
		Will have a lip between to keep secure

Friday - 1/18/2025
	Catching up on reading
	Meeting with Anshul
		Going over the LTA specifics, how to connect, how it reads out, where to get the lta_daemon
	
Monday - 1/20/2025
	Studying for prelim - Holiday!
	
Tuesday - 1/21/2025
	Meeting with Anshul
		Going over basics of skipper readout electronics and how the Skipper works
	Studying for Prelim

Wednesday - 1/22/2025
	Meeting with Steve and Kelian
		Testing LTA pinout and sequences
		There are more pins on the CCD, but we should be able to tie some of them together
		All of the labels seem to match up, A's are A's, except L's are also A's and U's are B's, contrary to what it says on the pinout sheets
		We are able to get one pin to oscillate between high and low, and the voltages match up with what is in the voltage files
			All very straightforward in the sequencer files
	Meeting with Erika
		FINESST outline mostly OK
			Make sure to include Tiffenberg figure and explain it, photo of our current setup/detector characterization setup
			Make sure to talk about us having a vacuum monochromator
			Make sure to mention we have been sent Skipper CCDs
			Make sure to mention that we are putting in an order for 8 wafers of Skipper CCDs (they will follow the Oscura architecture)
				4 of them will be sent (to JPL) to get uv optimized at the wafer level through backsurface passivation
				All of this is done with existing funding
			When talking about UV optimization, be careful to not give away who we are, very few groups do UV optimization and very few groups work with them
			Get assistance when writing the Expertise and Resources Not Anonymized section
				Seems like this is just the Research Readiness statement and bio sketches and current and pending support, no actual new section
	Fighting Github again :(
		Generating a new fine-grained PAT for the organization worked once, but not again
		Had to just make all repos in Hamden Lab public, solved all issues
		Had to remove a lot of files from .gitignore in the lta_Daemonpublic fork I made so we can add some of the testing scripts
	
Thursday - 1/23/2025
	Prelim planning meeting
		:(
		2 hour limit, 2 pages front and back, everything in questions we should know
	Working on 3D printer
		Looks like the changes they made to the internet broke our interent, not sure how to connect the 3D printer to a different internet
		Will probably just have to plug in a USB
	Lots of meetings today
