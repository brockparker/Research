	Downloading rest of PTC and QE Sophia data
	Organizing and making notes for all data
	Meeting with Shashank
		EMCCD basics
		NUVU operation
		Dark data reduction - same as for Sophia
	Taking EMCCD darks
		-115K, VSS 1
		Machine room light still on :(
	Sending out poll for lab tour
		Alex and co available Thursday

	VOTING!!!
	Updating Sophia plots
		Water damage
			Blurring sort of recreates the pre-damage images, although edge effects make it hard to compare
		Wavelength montage
			Creating movie of wavelengths to see how signal changes
			Signal changes likely due to both monochromator changes and fringing due to detector size
			Some data corrupted - seems to only be a side effect of downloading the data

	Sophia wavelength montage
		Very overexposed at short wavelengths - monochromator seems much less even at short wavelengths, diffuser would likely not be enough
		Also uneven and overexposed around 385 nm
		Final movie all have same limits, may want to recreate with limits based on the region of interest we optimized the exposure time for
	Sophia QE
		Finishing compiling all photodiode data into one dataframe/csv
		Need to add the photodiode error into dataframe
		Of note - photodiode response is not true, but rather a sample response curve from manufacturer, NOT NIST
	Compiling Caltech Optical Observatories software for Steve
		Apparently can't get it to work on Centos7
		Need cmake - Run sudo apt-get install cmake (already have)
		Need gcc - Run sudo apt-get install gcc (already have)
		Need cfitsio - Download the latest version https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/software/fitsio/c/cfitsio_latest.tar.gz
			     - Untar
			     - Inside the cfitsio-?.?.?/ folder, run ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
			     - Run sudo make
			     - Run sudo make install
		Need ccfits - Download the latest version https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/ccfits/CCfits-2.6.tar.gz
			    - Untar
			    - Inside the CCfits-?.? folder, run ./configure --with-cfitsio=/usr/local/cfitsio --prefix=/usr/local/CCfits 
			    - Run sudo make
			    - Run sudo make install
		Need gtest - Run sudo apt-get install libgtest-dev

	Alex and Co. Visit
		Lab tour - very interested in using our setup to characterize a few different CCD QEs in as far UV as we can go (down to 100nm according to Affy)
		They are currently debating two electron production at high photon energies, beginning to see a bump ~300nm from two electron production
			Want us to see if we see the same for any of our detectors, and maybe characterize some of theirs once they get them UV optimized at JPL
		Why don't we just use the integrating sphere, apparently it is broken but I am sure we can buy a new one
		Their QE currently does not include any inherent errors in the photodiode calibration
		Discussed how we plan to mount the Skipper to the cold finger
			They have had minor issues with their direct contact, but it may be easier to just clamp it on from the back without any springs or washers and use indium to create the thermal connection - could also copy aafaque and have pressure put on by opposite thermal expansions
		Very interested in mounting onto monochromator and the `plug and play' ability 
			Commercial monochromator from McPherson
			What do we do about stray light? - The slits and collimator help, but we need to add baffles before the slits and before the detector near the diffuser to help reduce stray light, Affy did stray light analysis and it shouldn't be too big of a deal
		May have some concern about dark current
			Bulk dark current shouldn't have much of an effect, surface will be a bigger deal
			Even bigger issue will probably be thermal dark from any IR sources - skippers are much much (>10x ~600 microns) thicker than EMCCDs
	Need to confirm with Affy how the light actually reaches the detector, is it not covered by the cold shroud, or does this help to properly disperse the light
	Finishing setting up COO Camera interface
		- Download latest version https://github.com/CaltechOpticalObservatories/camera-interface.git
		- Unzip
		- Inside the camera-interface-main/build folder, remove all files, rm -rf * (don't remove the .gitignore file)	
		- Run cmake .. (has to be cmake, not make)
		- Run make
	To test the Camera interface, inside of the camera-interface-main/build folder,
		- Run the camera server, ../bin/camerad ../Config/demo/demo.cfg --foreground OR ../bin/camerad -d ../Config/demo/demo.cfg
		- Run the archon emulator, ../bin/emulator ../Config/demo/demo.cfg
			Getting error "no instrument specified with -i <instrument>"
			Can specify -i generic, seems to make it work
		- Run the unit tests, ../bin/run_unit_tests
			This file just doesn't exist??
		- To connect to the running camera interface, inside of camera-interface-main/bin run telnet localhost 3031
			From here, can run load, expose, open, etc.
			Everything seems to work, difficult to test without Archon connected, will revisit next week with Steve
	TODO - Install Ubuntu and COO Camera-interface on my laptop to test with Archon
	Sophia Data Reduction Anshul
		Making a few example plots to compare with Anshul's data reduction script
		Comparing master bias and darks vs individual, plotting each reduced image, etc.
		Have to be careful when saving and opening data - data from sophia is in (1, 2048, 2048) array for some reason, but we save it as (2048, 2048), make sure data[0] is appropriate
